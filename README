Build Intructions
-----------------

Make sure you have the prerequisites listed below installed. Then, in theory,
simply type 'make'.

In practice it may be necessary to modify 'config.inc', then type 'make'.

This will build the python module 'peakolator.so' (in the 'src' directory) that is
required by the program 'peakolate' (also in 'src'), which is responsible for
actually running the scan. You can put these two files somewhere more
convenient, once they are built.



Prerequisites
-------------

Python (>=2.6) http://www.python.org/
Cython         http://www.cython.org/
GSL            http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
GMP            http://gmplib.org/
MPFR           http://www.mpfr.org/
NLopt          http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt
Boost          http://www.boost.org/



Usage
-----

The script 'peakolate' is responsible for running the command.

Run, './peakolate --help' for basic instructions.
